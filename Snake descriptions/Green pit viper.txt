These snakes are venomous and are known for their vibrant green coloration. Here is a small description of green pit vipers:

Appearance: Green pit vipers typically have a slender and moderately long body, with females usually being larger than males. They have a triangular-shaped head that is wider than the neck. The eyes are large and have vertical pupils. As the name suggests, they display various shades of green in their scales, ranging from bright green to olive green or even bluish-green hues. The body may also have additional patterns such as speckles or spots.

Venomous Nature: Green pit vipers are venomous snakes and possess fangs located at the front of their mouths. The venom is used to immobilize and subdue their prey. While their venom is potent, the effects on humans can vary depending on the species, the amount of venom injected, and individual sensitivities.

Habitat and Distribution: Green pit vipers are primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including countries such as India, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. They inhabit various habitats, including rainforests, dense vegetation, and even gardens or plantations. Some species of green pit vipers are known to be arboreal, spending much of their time in trees, while others may also be found on the ground.

Diet and Behavior: Green pit vipers are ambush predators, relying on their excellent camouflage to blend into their surroundings and wait for prey to approach. They primarily feed on small vertebrates, including frogs, lizards, birds, and small mammals. Green pit vipers are generally considered to be relatively docile, but they can become defensive and deliver a venomous bite if threatened or handled improperly.
