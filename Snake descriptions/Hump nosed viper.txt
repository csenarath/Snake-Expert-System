The hump-nosed viper refers to a group of venomous snakes belonging to the genus Hypnale. They are known for their distinctive hump-shaped nose and are found in parts of South Asia. Here is a small description of hump-nosed vipers:

Appearance: Hump-nosed vipers have a relatively stout body with a short, triangular head. Their most distinctive feature is the upturned, hump-shaped nose, which gives them their common name. They vary in coloration, but most species have a mix of brown, gray, or reddish-brown scales, often with darker patterns or blotches.

Venomous Nature: Hump-nosed vipers are venomous snakes. They possess venom glands and hollow fangs located at the front of their mouths. The venom is used to immobilize and subdue their prey. While the effects of their venom can vary depending on the species and individual factors, bites from hump-nosed vipers can be medically significant and should be treated as a medical emergency.

Habitat and Distribution: Hump-nosed vipers are found in various habitats, including rainforests, grasslands, and rocky areas. They are native to regions of South Asia, including countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia. Some species of hump-nosed vipers are known to be terrestrial, while others may be arboreal or semi-arboreal.

Diet and Behavior: Hump-nosed vipers are ambush predators that feed primarily on small mammals, lizards, frogs, and other snakes. They are generally nocturnal and exhibit secretive behavior, often hiding under vegetation or in crevices during the day. When threatened, they may adopt defensive postures, hiss, and strike if necessary.
