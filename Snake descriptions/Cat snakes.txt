Boiga ceylonensis, commonly known as the Sri Lankan cat snake or Ceylon cat snake, is a non-venomous snake species native to Sri Lanka. It is a member of the family Colubridae. Here is a small description of Boiga ceylonensis:

Appearance: Boiga ceylonensis is a slender and elongated snake with a moderately long body. It can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters (5 feet). The head is triangular and slightly wider than the neck, with large eyes and distinctive round pupils. The body is typically brown or gray in color, often with a pattern of darker blotches or crossbands running along the length of the snake. The scales are smooth and glossy.

Habitat: This snake species is primarily found in forested areas, including both lowland and montane forests. It is also known to inhabit plantations and gardens. Boiga ceylonensis is primarily arboreal, meaning it spends much of its time in trees and shrubs, although it may descend to the ground occasionally.

Behavior and Diet: Boiga ceylonensis is a nocturnal and secretive snake. It is known for its excellent climbing abilities and can move swiftly through the trees. As an opportunistic predator, its diet primarily consists of small vertebrates, including birds, lizards, and rodents.

Unique Characteristics: One distinctive feature of Boiga ceylonensis is its ability to flatten its body, allowing it to move effortlessly through dense vegetation. While it is non-venomous, this snake can deliver a painful bite if provoked or handled improperly.

Conservation Status: Boiga ceylonensis is not currently evaluated by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) for its conservation status. However, as deforestation and habitat degradation continue to pose threats to its natural habitat, conservation efforts are necessary to protect the species and its ecosystem.
