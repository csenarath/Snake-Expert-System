The saw-scaled viper (Echis carinatus) is a highly venomous snake species found in parts of Africa, the Middle East, and the Indian subcontinent. Here is a description of the saw-scaled viper:

Appearance: Saw-scaled vipers are relatively small to medium-sized snakes with a stout body. They have a triangular-shaped head that is broader than the neck. The scales on their body are keeled, giving them a rough texture. The coloration can vary, but they typically have a sandy or brownish background color with darker patterns or markings. Some individuals may have a reddish or yellowish hue.

Venomous Nature: Saw-scaled vipers are known for their potent venom and aggressive behavior. They possess long, hinged fangs that fold back when not in use and can deliver quick and multiple strikes. The venom of the saw-scaled viper is cytotoxic, causing tissue damage, and may also have hemotoxic effects. Bites from saw-scaled vipers can be extremely painful and can lead to swelling, blistering, and systemic effects.

Habitat and Distribution: Saw-scaled vipers inhabit a variety of habitats, including desert regions, dry grasslands, and scrublands. They are found in countries such as India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, parts of the Middle East, and various countries in Africa. Some species of saw-scaled vipers are known for their adaptability to urban areas.

Diet and Behavior: Saw-scaled vipers are primarily nocturnal and feed on small vertebrates, including rodents, lizards, and other snakes. They are highly alert and defensive snakes, known for their characteristic behavior of rubbing their scales together to produce a "sawing" or "sizzling" sound when threatened. This sound serves as a warning and is meant to intimidate potential predators or threats.
