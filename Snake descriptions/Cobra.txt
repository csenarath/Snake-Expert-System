Cobras are a group of venomous snakes belonging to the family Elapidae, and they are known for their iconic hooded appearance. Here is a small description of cobras:

Appearance: Cobras have a relatively long and cylindrical body, typically ranging from 1 to 3 meters (3 to 10 feet) in length, depending on the species. They have a distinct head that is elongated and slightly wider than the neck. One of the most notable features of cobras is their ability to spread their necks into a hood when threatened or during territorial displays. The hood is created by the extension of elongated ribs and skin, forming a characteristic "figure-eight" shape.

Venomous Nature: Cobras are venomous snakes, equipped with hollow fangs located at the front of their mouths. They possess potent venom, which they use to immobilize and subdue their prey. The venom is delivered through a bite and can be life-threatening to their prey or pose a significant danger to humans if envenomated.

Habitat and Distribution: Cobras inhabit a wide range of habitats, including forests, grasslands, deserts, and even urban areas. They are found in various parts of the world, with different species distributed across Africa, Asia, and parts of the Middle East.

Diet and Behavior: Cobras are carnivorous predators that feed primarily on small mammals, birds, lizards, and other snakes. They are known for their stealthy hunting behavior, often ambushing their prey. When threatened, cobras can become highly aggressive and will display their hood as a warning sign. If provoked, they may strike to defend themselves, delivering venomous bites.
